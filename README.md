The chrome extension entrance to call Reddit Summarizer api with current url and retrieves json. 

### 2017-08-22
Functioning with java backend for the first time.
- Needs to format/factor the response message into proper html.
- Refactor code to make it look not like garbage js.
- Maybe add a buffer state before the response, use jQuery/ajax instead because it provides callbacks?
- Better UI and get an actual icon img.
